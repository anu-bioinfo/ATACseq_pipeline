Sentences from publications/public resources, hence
**must** be rephrased.

- both methods reproducibly capture the tissue-specific chromatin activity of
  regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators

- we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as
  nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated.

- we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined
  with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional
  genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks
  controlling complex in vivo processes.

- Gene expression in higher eukaryotes is tightly controlled by complex
  cis-regulatory systems consisting of multiple enhancers modulating the
  transcription levels of a target gene.

- to decipher the genomic cis-regulatory logic underlying a cell typeâ€™s
  functional transcriptome

- Understanding changes in regulatory landscapes between different cell types,
  for example during cellular differentiation, or between normal and diseased
  cellular states, can furthermore provide a bridge between the genomic
  sequence and emerging transcriptome changes.
