Sentences from publications/public resources, hence
**must** be rephrased.

- both methods reproducibly capture the tissue-specific chromatin activity of
  regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators

- we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as
  nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated.

- we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined
  with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional
  genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks
  controlling complex in vivo processes.

- Gene expression in higher eukaryotes is tightly controlled by complex
  cis-regulatory systems consisting of multiple enhancers modulating the
  transcription levels of a target gene.

- to decipher the genomic cis-regulatory logic underlying a cell typeâ€™s
  functional transcriptome

- Understanding changes in regulatory landscapes between different cell types,
  for example during cellular differentiation, or between normal and diseased
  cellular states, can furthermore provide a bridge between the genomic
  sequence and emerging transcriptome changes.

-  In addition, nucleosomes flanking active regulatory regions usually carry histone
modifications, such as H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 [PMID:22955616], and in human and other vertebrates, active
promoters and enhancers may have dynamic hyper- or hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides,
denoting inactive and active enhancers respectively, whereby changes in methylation
usually accompany changes in activity [PMID:22641018].

- Davie K, Jacobs J, Atkins M, et al. Discovery of Transcription Factors and Regulatory Regions Driving In Vivo Tumor Development by ATAC-seq and FAIRE-seq Open Chromatin Profiling. McKinnon P, ed. PLoS Genetics. 2015;11(2):e1004994. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004994. This paper shows some ATAC-specific and not present in DNase peaks. Also,
here they use DESeq2. Also, here they talk about how specificity is not the best parameter to compare ATAC and FAIRE.
