Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)

Step 1 Cross-linking
Addition of formaldehyde results in the cross-linking of DNA segments to proteins and the cross-linking of proteins with each other.

Step 2 Restriction digest
A restriction enzyme is added in excess to the cross-linked DNA, separating the non-cross-linked DNA from the cross-linked chromatin.

Step 3 Intramolecular Ligation
Using very low concentrations of DNA favors the ligation of relevant DNA fragments with the corresponding junctions instead of the ligation of random fragments.
- There are two major types of ligation junctions that are over-represented. One is the junction that forms between neighboring DNA fragments due to incomplete digestion, which represents about 20-30% of all junctions.
- The other type of junctions over-represented here is the junction that forms when one end of the fragment ligates with the other end of the same fragment, and contributes up to 30% of all junctions formed.

Step 4 Reverse Cross-links
High temperature will result in the reversal of cross-links formed in step 1.
The resulting linear DNA fragment has specific restriction ends as well as a central restriction site corresponding to the site of ligation.

Step 5 Quantitation
PCR uses primers against the site of ligation to semi-quantitatively assess the frequencies of a restriction fragment of interest.

Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C)

Steps 1-4
See procedure listed in 3C. 6-bp-cutters are preferred in step 2.

Step 5a Second Restriction Digest
Another round of restriction digest with a frequent cutter resulting in smaller fragments with restriction ends that differ from the central restriction site (ligation junction).

Step 5b Self-circularization
Self-circularization of the DNA fragments is more favored now that they are not bound to other proteins or fragments.
Intramolecular ligation occurs to induce the formation of the circular fragments.

Step 5c Inverse PCR and Quantitation
Primers are designed against the outer restriction sites of the “bait” sequence,
which result in the amplification of the small unknown captured fragment.
Large-scale sequencing can be used to sequence the 4C library.
