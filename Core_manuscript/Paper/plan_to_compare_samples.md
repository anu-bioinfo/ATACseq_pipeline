Plan of sample comparisons
---------------------------------

After deciding on a peak caller to use (FSeq), we need to compare samples
generated from different types of material (fresh, frozen, different types of
fixed).

**Repeat all standard analysis and stats**

- number of called peaks
- number of called peaks normalized by library size
- average peak intensity
- normalized signal-to-noise ratio
- peak width distribution
- % overlap with DNaseI peaks
- % overlap with annotation "on-target"
- % overlap with annotation "off-target"
- % overlap with each functional group of the annotation
- average peak intensity per group
- average peak width per group
- number of peaks overlapping between two material types in a pairwise manner
- pairwise overlap between different types of material and its description
  (height, width, overlap with functional categories)
- similar analysis of peaks specific for each type of material (height, width,
  overlap with functional categories)
- sequence analysis of common peaks
- sequence analysis of unique peeaks
