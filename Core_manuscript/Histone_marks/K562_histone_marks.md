Histone marks and their overlap with ATAC
---------------------------------------

General information about histone modifications and what each histone mark is
responsible for can be found
[here](https://github.com/jknightlab/ATACseq_pipeline/blob/master/Core_manuscript/Paper/histone_marks_overview.md).

Within the ENCODE project, three groups generated
[histone marks for K562](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/peaks/jan2011/histone_macs/optimal/hub/):

| Broad    | SYDH*    | UW**     |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| H2az     |          |          |
| H3k4me1  | H3k4me1  |          |
| H3k4me2  |          |          |
| H3k4me3  | H3k4me3  | H3k4me3  |
| H3k9ac   | H3k9acb  |          |
| H3k9me3  |          |          |
| H3k27ac  |          |          |
| H3k27me3 | H3k27me3 | H3k27me3 |
| H3k36me3 |          | H3k36me3 |
| H3k79me2 |          |          |
| H4k20me1 |          |          |

* SYDH = Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard; ** UW = University of Washington.

We started with three histone marks generated by UW.

#### General information

Number of peaks:

- 21,732 for H3k27me3
- 30,760 for H3k36me3
- 22,664 for H3k4me3

#### Overlap of histone marks and ATAC/DNase

| Name of a histon mark | Number of peaks | Overlap with ATAC | Overlap with DNase |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| H3k27me3              | 21732           | 829               | 2009               |
| H3k36me3              | 30760           | 2512              | 4328               |
| H3k4me3               | 22664           | 22796             | 25216              |
