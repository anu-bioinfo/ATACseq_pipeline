Comparing ATAC, DNaseI and FAIRE samples
------------------------------------------

#### Workflow

`1.` We downloaded DNaseI data from
[here](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EKN/).
Three replicates for K562 were available. Description of samples from the
ENCODE website: K562 (Homo sapiens, adult 53 year female), immortalized cell
line, isogenic replicates, DNase-seq on human K562 treated with SAHA at 1uM for
72 hour. Treaed with 1 Î¼M vorinostat (CHEBI:45716) for 72 hours.

We downloaded FAIRE data from
[here](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000DCK/).
Only two replicates for K562 data were available.  Description of samples from
the ENCODE website: K562 (Homo sapiens, adult 53 year female), immortalized
cell line, isogenic replicates, FAIRE-seq on human K562, treated with 100 uM
hydroxyurea for 72 hours.
```
ENCFF000TLN.bam -> faire.rep1.bam
ENCFF000TLP.bam -> faire.rep2.bam
```

`2.` We downsampled DNaseI and FAIRE data to the amount of reads in fresh
samples.

|                    | Replicate 1 | Replicate 2 | Replicate 3 |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Fresh ATAC         |  11,785,502 |  12,841,034 |  10,954,818 |
| Frozen ATAC        |  15,377,840 |  15,690,118 |  16,869,520 |
| DNaseI             | 166,566,404 | 160,212,700 | 176,522,007 |
| DNaseI downsampled |  11,782,306 |  12,830,604 |  10,967,282 |
| FAIRE              |  64,997,252 |  73,682,365 |      -      |
| FAIRE downsampled  |  11,782,011 |  12,845,269 |      -      |

Downsampling:
```
samtools view -b -s 0.1813 faire.rep1.bam > faire.rep1.fseq_downs.bam
samtools view -b -s 0.1743 faire.rep2.bam > faire.rep2.fseq_downs.bam
```

`3.` We analyzed DNaseI and FAIRE data with
[pinechrom](https://github.com/jknightlab/ATACseq_pipeline/tree/master/Core_manuscript/Pinechrom)
in the same way we analyzed ATAC data (using F-Seq as a peak caller).
